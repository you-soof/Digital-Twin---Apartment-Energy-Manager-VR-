# Digital_Twin_Apartment_Energy_Manager_(VR)
I’m building a VR simulation of a smart apartment where users can interact with appliances like lights, thermostats, and plugs. The idea is to test whether a virtual digital twin dashboard makes it easier for people to understand and manage their home energy use. Instead of abstract charts or mobile apps, the user directly experiences the apartment and sees the energy feedback in real-time. It’s great for XR because it turns data into something you can see, feel, and interact with — which could be a game changer for sustainability and smart home education.
